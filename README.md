Our project aims to simplify the organization of lunch parties by automating the food delivery process. In our case, we are hosting 19 guests at a lunch party and intend to serve them a delicious main course, originally planned as "biryani." However, after some calculations, we have decided to change the menu to "pizza."

The project focuses on efficiently managing the quantity of biryani required for the party. At the beginning of the project, we display information about the original menu and the new menu to inform all participants of the change.

Next, we calculate the number of biryani servings needed, assuming that each person will receive one serving. The available quantity of biryani is 20 servings, so we check if we have enough biryani for the party (variable "enough_biryani").

The project also takes into account that the number of guests may change. Therefore, we increment the "guests" variable by 1 to accommodate the new guest. Then, we calculate how many biryani servings each guest will receive after this change (variable "biryani_per_guest") based on the available biryani.

This project aims to automate the food delivery process for lunch parties to ensure we always have the right amount of food for our guests.
